NETFLIX USERBASE DISTRIBUTION:
Neflix is one of the most popular OTT streaming platforms around the world. It is available across various countries of the world and it can be accessed in multiple devices.
In this project, we have a dataset with various features pertaining to the distribution details of users across the world.
I have developed a robust visualisation using PoweBI for this dataset along with customizable filters in order to establish various relationships betweem the features. 
This  viduzlization would help in providing an overall understanding of the users based on the countries, devices, gender, age group and so on.
